# Work-Day-Scheduler

As this week's homework, we aim to create a daily planner schedule that allows employees to set themselves for success by planning their day so that you can manage your time effectively. This daily planner will allow anyone that uses it to store their daily routine and save it. You will be notified when the event is past, current, or ahead base on the coloring. Also when you refresh the page your events will still be there unless you decide to clear it.
